### Welcome Dear Viewer, my name is Patryk
I am a Senior QA Engineer with an E-Commerce/Gaming/Hardware background. I specialize in Java, but my thirst for knowledge can't pull me away from learning, so I am also familiar with Python and JavaScript.  
  
Currently in a process of learning & transitioning into Full-Stack Developer. For a direct contact you can find me on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/wronskipatryk](LinkedIn)
